<a name="head1"><center><h2>Overview</h2></center></a>

<p>

Emissions of carbon dioxide from the combustion of fossil fuels are dwarfed by carbon dioxide
emissions

and absorption from natural processes. As noted in Chapter 1, natural processes in the oceans and
biomass

are responsible for most carbon dioxide absorption and emissions. This is also true of methane
and nitrous

oxide. Most methane and nitrous oxide are created by bacteria in soils and wetlands. Although
the most

important natural processes affecting greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are not
subject to

human control, modifications in land use can influence their concentrations in significant ways.

<p>

The magnitude of the influence is difficult to measure. Unlike service station pumps, trees and
swamps

do not come equipped with meters. Thus, analysts can only estimate emissions or sequestration
on the

basis of small sample surveys and extrapolate (with associated uncertainty) to much larger
regions. A

second, related problem is distinguishing between human-caused and natural phenomena. An
electric

power plant is clearly a human artifact. Trees growing back over abandoned farmland are a more

ambiguous case.

<p>



<a name="head2"><center><h2>Forests and the Carbon Budget</h2></center></a>

<p>

The most important changes in land use affecting the carbon budget are those that increase or
reduce

forest land. Every year in the United States and throughout the world a very large amount of
carbon

dioxide, on the order of 100 billion metric tons, is removed from the atmosphere and sequestered
into

biomass <a href="notes.html#h96">[<b>96</b>]</a>. At the same time, carbon is released to the

atmosphere from vegetative respiration, combustion of wood as fuel, degradation of
manufactured wood

products, and the natural decay of expired vegetation. The net numerical difference, or flux,
between

carbon sequestration and release can be viewed as a measure of the relative contribution of
biomass to

the carbon cycle. World flux is difficult to measure but is thought to be close to zero; in other
words,

sequestration and respiration are roughly in balance worldwide <a

href="notes.html#h97">[<b>97</b>]</a>. In the United States, however, forests and the wood
products

produced from them sequestered a net of approximately 111 million metric tons of carbon (407
million

metric tons of carbon dioxide) in 1992, including 12 million metric tons of carbon sequestered in
wood

products and 15 million metric tons of carbon sequestered in landfilled wood product waste <a

href="notes.html#h98">[<b>98</b>]</a>. A further 127 million metric tons of carbon is
believed to be

sequestered in forest soils. Sequestered carbon offset 8 to 17 percent of the 1,381 million metric
tons of

carbon (or 5,068 million metric tons of carbon dioxide) emitted in the United States in 1992 from
the

burning of fossil fuels (see <a href="2tabs.html#tbl05">Chapter 2</a>).

<p>

Estimates of carbon sequestration for years after 1992 are not currently available, but the U.S.
Forest

Service has made projections for 1993-1995 based on the assumption that historical trends before
1992

continued unchanged. These projections, which are 2 to 3 percent lower than the 1992 estimate,
result in

projected carbon sequestration in 1994 equivalent to approximately 12 percent of U.S. carbon
dioxide

emissions for that year <a href="notes.html#h99">[<b>99</b>]</a>.

<p>

The current inventory of carbon in U.S. forests is enormous. A study by researchers Birdsey and
Heath

of the U.S. Forest Service estimated that U.S. forest ecosystems contained 54.6 billion metric
tons of carbon

in 1992 <a href="notes.html#h100">[<b>100</b>]</a>&#151;the equivalent of nearly 40 years
of U.S. carbon

emissions from fossil fuel consumption.

<p>

Table 37 shows U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service estimates of the
major uses

of land in the United States, developed through a periodic sample survey that is updated every 5
years

(the last update was 1992). The USDA publication that gives the most comprehensive view of
land use,

<i>Major Uses of Land in the United States</i>, indicates that between 1987 and 1992 there was
a net

increase of 6 million acres of forest land <a href="notes.html#h101">[<b>101</b>]</a>. Table
37 indicates

that &#147;Forest-Use Land&#148; remained stable at 648 million acres between 1987 and
1992. However,

&#147;Special-Use Areas&#148; include extensive forest land in the form of National Parks and
wilderness

areas. In 1992, forested &#147;Special-Use Areas&#148; accounted for nearly 89 million acres.
As a result,

forested land in the U.S. totals about 737 million acres.

<center><h3>New Sequestration Estimate</h3></center>

<p>

Last year, the principal researchers on the topic of carbon sequestration in U.S. forests, Birdsey
and Heath,

published a new estimate of 238 million metric tons of carbon sequestered per year during the
period

1987-1992. The EPA, in its examination of the carbon sequestration issue, elected to use Birdsey
and

Heath&#146;s estimates, excluding the most uncertain element, carbon sequestration in forest
soils (called

&#147;dead flux&#148; by Birdsey and Heath), which they estimated at 127 million metric tons
annually.

<p>

There is a considerable body of forestry research, backed by a large body of data, on the amount
of

marketable timber produced by forests of various types. That research can be effectively
harnessed to

estimate the quantity of carbon incorporated into the wood of trees. The principal uncertainties
are data

uncertainties: it is a challenge to characterize accurately the 737 million acres of forest land in the
United

States (33 percent of the Nation&#146;s land area) in terms of tree species, stand age and height,
etc., in order

to apply tested forestry methods to an estimation of carbon sequestration.

<p>

Research on forest soils is much more sparse, and the characterization of 737 million acres of
forest soil

is more speculative than the characterization of the trees themselves. It seems more likely than
not that

significant quantities of carbon are sequestered in forest soils, but there are no reliable estimates
of the

actual amounts.

The 737 million acres of forest land in the United States represents approximately two-thirds of
the area

that was forested in the year 1600 (1.04 billion acres) <a
href="notes.html#h102">[<b>102</b>]</a>.

Figure 12 illustrates the extent of forest land in the coterminous United States in 1620, 1850,
1920, and

1992. Three important facts are highlighted by these maps. First, slightly less than 50 percent of
the land

area of the United States has historically contained forest, primarily because large areas of U.S.
land are

inhospitable to trees, limiting maximum potential carbon sequestration. Areas suitable for forest
are

concentrated primarily east of the Mississippi, in the Pacific Northwest, and in western Colorado.
Second,

very little of the extensive forest present in 1620 remained by 1920, most having been cleared for

agriculture and to produce timber; by 1920, the clearing of forests for agriculture had largely
come to an

end. Third, large areas returned to forest between 1920 and 1992, especially in the East where

abandonment of agriculture set the stage for large-scale forest regrowth.

<p>

<a name="fig12"><img border=1 src="fig12.gif"></a>

<p>

Aggregate annual carbon sequestration generally follows trends in forest cover, except when
biomass

density on forest lands changes dramatically, such as from either extensive timber harvesting
(which

results in forest land that sequesters relatively little carbon) or from a long-term lull in harvesting
(which

results in forest land that sequesters relatively large amounts of carbon).

<p>

The regrowth of U.S. forests has had important impacts on net U.S. carbon dioxide emissions.
U.S. forests

have been a net carbon sink since 1952. According to Forest Service researchers Richard Birdsey
and Linda

Heath, between 1952 and 1992, carbon stored on U.S. forest land increased by 11.3 billion metric
tons, an

average of 281 million metric tons per year, and an amount that offset approximately 25 percent
of U.S.

emissions of carbon for the period <a href="notes.html#h103">[<b>103</b>]</a>. In addition to

reforestation associated with the abandonment of agriculture in the East, more than 4 million
acres of

marginal cropland have been reforested since 1974 under such Federal programs as the
Conservation

Reserve Program, Agricultural Conservation Program, and Forestry Incentives Program <a

href="notes.html#h104">[<b>104</b>]</a>. Birdsey and Heath estimated that U.S. forests will
continue

to be net carbon sinks well into the future, sequestering carbon at an average net annual rate of
177

million metric tons between 1992 and 2040 (not including sequestration into wood products and
landfills),

for a total increase in stored carbon of 8.5 billion metric tons <a
href="notes.html#h105">[<b>105</b>]</a>.

<p>



<a name="head3"><center><h2>Cropland and the Carbon Budget</h2></center></a>

<p>

It is difficult to be specific about how much carbon might be gained or lost through
transformations of

grasslands, pasturelands, or croplands. Although the amount of carbon in a square meter of forest
might

be on the order of 9 to 26 kilograms, depending on the condition of the forest and the age and
type of

trees growing, typical estimates of carbon storage in cultivated lands range from 1 to 8 kilograms
per

square meter, and estimates for uncultivated (but cultivatable) lands range from 2 to 10 kilograms
per

square meter <a href="notes.html#h106">[<b>106</b>]</a>. Thus, there is less carbon to be
gained or

lost, and the range of possible outcomes per unit of land is consequently smaller.

<p>

Between 1987 and 1992, the extent of cropland in use in the United States increased by 9 million
acres,

while the amount of idle cropland declined by 12 million acres. The shift from idled to cultivated
and

grazed cropland should, in principle, lead to small decreases in net carbon storage. Shifts from
any of the

above to urban land, the fastest single growth category, should lead to stable or slightly reduced
storage.

Land in urban areas, as measured by the Bureau of the Census, totaled 55.9 million acres in 1990,
up from

47.3 million acres in 1980 <a href="notes.html#h107">[<b>107</b>]</a>.

<p>



<a name="head4"><center><h2>Methane Emissions from Wetlands</h2></center></a>

<p>

The range of observed methane fluxes from U.S. wetlands is enormous. One survey of
experiments

conducted in the United States found estimates ranging from a negative flux (methane
absorption) to a

flux of 213 grams of methane per square meter per year, largely dependent on habitat type <a

href="notes.html#h108">[<b>108</b>]</a>. Thus, it is difficult to extrapolate from
experimental data to

large-scale emissions estimates.

<p>

Estimates of global methane fluxes from wetlands tend to indicate that methane emissions from 

temperate-zone wetlands are minimal&#151;typically between 5 and 10 million metric tons of
methane per year for

worldwide temperate-zone wetlands (which include U.S. wetlands)&#151;when compared with
estimated global

wetlands emissions of 110 million metric tons <a href="notes.html#h109">[<b>109</b>]</a>.
The U.S.

share of all temperate-zone wetlands is about 57 percent, and U.S. wetlands lost during the 1980s

accounted for about 0.5 percent of the extent of wetlands at the beginning of the period.
Consequently,

the reduction in natural methane emissions from U.S. wetlands lost might be on the order of
10,000 to

20,000 metric tons annually over the decade.

<p>



<a name="head5"><center><h2>Effects of Land Use Changes on Methane and Nitrous Oxide
Emissions</h2></center></a>

<p>

The scientific literature suggests that grass and forest lands are both weak natural sinks for
methane and

weak natural sources for nitrous oxide, although adequate research to establish accurate estimates
of

aggregate methane and nitrous oxide emissions and sequestration is lacking. Natural soils
apparently

serve as methane sinks: well-aerated soils contain a class of bacteria called
&#147;methanotrophs&#148;

which use methane as food and oxidize it into carbon dioxide. Experiments indicate that
cultivation

reduces methane uptake by soils and increases nitrous oxide emissions <a

href="notes.html#h110">[<b>110</b>]</a>. Exactly how much methane is absorbed by natural
soils, and

how much nitrous oxide is emitted, is difficult to estimate, although total amounts are very small.

<p>

It is known that conversion of forests and grasslands to cropland accelerates nitrogen cycling and
increases

nitrous oxide emissions from the soil. It is not known with certainty by how much (see <a
href="appa.html#cite11">Appendix A</a>) <a
