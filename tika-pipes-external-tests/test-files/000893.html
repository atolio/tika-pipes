      <td height="383" colspan="2" valign="top" bgcolor="#F7F2D7"><div align="left"><p class="style1">Founded at the fall line of the James River  in the Piedmont of Virginia, Richmond  is at the head of navigation of the river, an ideal spot for a port. The town  spread out over a series of hills and beyond along both sides of the river naturally  evolving as a center for trade and commerce with the location of its commercial  and residential districts, public buildings, and industrial areas shaped by  topography.&nbsp; Its site, ties to the  tobacco industry, and transportation innovations ultimately positioned Richmond  to become one of the most commercially successful cities in the South.<br /> <br />
        Before the arrival of the first European settlers in the  early 17th century following the granting of a royal charter by James I to the  Virginia Company of London, Indian  tribes of the Powatan Confederacy lived in the area.&nbsp; John Rolfe&rsquo;s successful venture with tobacco  in 1614 prompted settlers to travel westward, establishing large plantations  along the James River that would utilize the rich soil  of the region.&nbsp; Early in the colony&rsquo;s  history, the Byrd family erected profitable tobacco warehouses near the falls  of the river.&nbsp; When the Warehouse Act of  1730 designated the falls of the James as one of the 40 required locations  throughout the colony where tobacco inspectors graded the product, the Byrd  holdings became even more valuable.&nbsp;  Pressure from the House of Burgesses prompted William Byrd II  to found the town of Richmond in  1733 as a trading center on the James River. In 1737,  Major William Mayo laid out 32 squares and streets for the town on what is now Church  Hill. A rival settlement, Rocky Ridge, developed on the south bank of the James   River.&nbsp; The original 1737  plan of Richmond and the 1769 plan  of Rocky Ridge (later Manchester)  are still evident in the <a href="ShockoeValleyTobaccoHD.htm">Shockoe Valley  and Tobacco Row</a> and the <a href="ManchesterResidentialHD.html">Manchester Residential and Commercial Historic  Districts</a>.<br />

        <p class="style1">Although not a sophisticated town by the time of its  official incorporation in 1742, Richmond grew because of its increasing commercial success.&nbsp; The network of regional roads  expanded, connecting the port to numerous plantations and the well-established  town of Williamsburg.&nbsp; Furs, tobacco, and other crops passed through  Richmond for shipment across the Atlantic.&nbsp; During the years preceding the American Revolution,  approximately one-sixth of the tobacco crop sold in Richmond,  which required additional coopers, blacksmiths, and warehouses. A market at 17th  and Main Streets provided a venue for farmers to sell their wares. The open-air  market is still in operation today at the original location, more than 200  years later.&nbsp; Only a few buildings from  this colonial period remain, including the <u><a href="OldStoneHouse.htm">Old Stone House</a></u> of c. 1740,  which is now the Edgar Allan   Poe Museum.&nbsp; Built by a tobacco merchant in 1771, the  Archibald Freeland House, the oldest house in the Manchester Residential and  Commercial Historic District, and the <u><a href="Woodward.html">Woodward House</a></u>, the last surviving  building from the once-bustling port   of Rocketts Landing, are testaments  to the commercial success of Richmond  during this time.<br /> 
          <br />
          Whereas Virginia's colonial capital, Williamsburg, was a seasonal town, Richmond  remained active throughout the year.&nbsp; The  town&rsquo;s commercial activity and convenient location made it a fine site for a  central government.&nbsp; Advocates of this  idea included Thomas Jefferson, who eventually helped design the <u><a href="VirginiaStateCapitol.html">State  Capitol</a></u><a href="VirginiaStateCapitol.html">.</a>&nbsp; After the seat of  government moved from Williamsburg  to Richmond in 1779, the city  emerged as the &ldquo;Metropolis of Virginia&rdquo; and one of the most important cities in  the early United States  during this era.&nbsp; The population increased from a few hundred people in  1782 to nearly 6,000 by the turn of the 19th century.&nbsp; Local leaders  looked to transportation and industry to make Richmond  both the political and economic capital of Virginia,  and during the Federal period, the city grew rapidly as a governmental,  manufacturing, and transportation center.<br /> 
          <br />Conceived by George Washington, the <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/JamesRCanal.html">James River and Kanawha Canal</a></u> was the  first canal in the United States and, like the James River, integral  to Richmond&rsquo;s development.&nbsp; Begun in 1785, the canal  eventually stretched 197 miles westward from Richmond to the town of Buchanan in the Allegheny   Mountains.&nbsp; The canal allowed boats to bypass the  falls and bring agricultural and forest products from areas further west in Virginia providing employment for boatmen and assisting the  growth of the iron, flour milling, and quarrying industries along the  river.&nbsp; The canal was the city&rsquo;s primary means of connection with points  west until the railways eclipsed it in the second half of the 19th century.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/ShockoeSlipHD.html">Shockoe Slip</a>, Richmond&rsquo;s oldest mercantile district, developed in proximity  to the Great Shiplock and the mills surrounding the canal Turning Basin.&nbsp; Ships departing from Richmond&rsquo;s ports bearing loads of flour would travel as far as  Australia, Brazil, and California, bringing back other goods such as coffee for  processing locally.<br />
          <br />
        The canal also helped in the shipment of coal mined in the  region.&nbsp; The coal industry developed  early on in Richmond&rsquo;s history and  had a major impact on trade and transportation.&nbsp;  The first coal mine in North America was at the Midlothian  coalfields in Chesterfield County,  and by 1763, the mines produced 14,000 tons of coal each year.&nbsp; Until the 1830s, these eastern Virginia  mines were the main source of coal in North America, providing  coal shipped to New England, the West Indies,  and Europe.&nbsp; Present-day  Midlothian Turnpike and Broad Street  initially developed to facilitate the transportation of coal from the mines to  ports in Richmond and Manchester,  and in 1831 the Chesterfield Railroad was built to speed transportation.&nbsp; This gravity-powered rail was the first in Virginia  and the second in the United States. </p>

        <p class="style1">Spurred by the success of the canal and the relocation of the  capital, Richmond experienced a  period of steady growth and development in the early decades of the 19th  century.&nbsp; The transportation network and associated industrialization  made Richmond an important economic  center, and during the 1840s, Richmond  was the largest tobacco production market in the world.&nbsp; The construction of more than 50 tobacco  factories in Shockoe Valley  made tobacco the dominant industry in this area in the late 19th and early 20th  centuries as well.&nbsp; Tobacco factories and warehouses dating from between  1880 and 1930 remain throughout this historic district.&nbsp; Today, most of  the large warehouses and factories along Tobacco Row are converted to  apartments, condominiums, restaurants, and office space.&nbsp; Collectively,  they represent one of the largest contiguous adaptive reuse projects in the  country.<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/Tredegar.html">Tredegar Iron Works</a>, a National Historic  Landmark, opened in 1837, taking its name from the famous iron works at  Tredegar, Wales.&nbsp; Proximity to a waterpower source and working  coalfields, and development of the railroad industry from c. 1830 to c. 1850  made Richmond the iron and coal center of the South.&nbsp; The  foundry&rsquo;s ability to produce massive quantities of ammunition was an important  factor in the selection of Richmond as the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil  War.&nbsp; By 1860, the city&rsquo;s population grew to nearly 38,000 - making it by  far the largest town in Virginia and one of the largest in the South.<br />

          In 1865, the retreating Confederate army started  the infamous evacuation fire that destroyed a substantial number of the  buildings in Richmond&rsquo;s core.&nbsp; The city rapidly rebuilt, continuing as  a center of the tobacco trade.&nbsp; With economic and population growth, a  large downtown business district, extensive warehouse and industrial areas, and  diverse residential neighborhoods developed.&nbsp; The early financial  institutions in the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/MainStBanking.html">Main Street Banking Historic District</a> and  commercial buildings such as the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/StearnsDonnanAsher.html">Stearns and Donnan-Asher Iron-Front Buildings</a> date to the post-Civil War period.&nbsp; <br />
          <br />
          The Virginia Central Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad dominated the Shockoe Valley and Tobacco Row area after the Civil War.  &nbsp;Elevated railroad tracks were a part of the improvements to the railroad  network.&nbsp; The confluence of so many railroads prompted construction in 1901 of the <u><a href="MainSTStation.html">Main Street Station</a></u>, a National  Historic Landmark.&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently restored to its early grandeur, the  station is to become a centrally located multi-modal transportation hub.&nbsp;  Elevated railroad tracks, including the well-known Triple Crossing, a point at  which three different railroads crossed one over the other, date to the same  period.&nbsp; Another monumental train station, John Russell Pope&rsquo;s 1919 <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/BroadStreetStation.html">Broad Street Station</a></u> furthered the city&rsquo;s extensive  rail network and allowed it to continue to grow as a center of manufacturing,  wholesale distribution, and retail sales. </p>

        <p class="style1">Richmond was also home to the first successful electric  streetcar system in the United States.&nbsp; Originating in 1887, with a design by  Philadelphia engineer Frank Sprague, the network of trolley lines gave rise to  some of the country&rsquo;s early &ldquo;streetcar suburbs,&rdquo; including the <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/GinterParkHD.html">Ginter Park</a></u> and <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/TownBartonHeights.html">Town of Barton Heights</a></u> Historic  Districts.&nbsp; The James   River, the provider of transportation as well as  water for powering mills and factories, was harnessed for electricity and even  streetcars.&nbsp; <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/BelleIsle.html">Belle Isle</a></u>, formerly a camp for  captured Union soldiers, was the location of an early hydroelectric plant that  provided power for streetcars on the south side of the river, where the trolley  line headed west to its terminus at <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/ForestHillPark.html">Forest Hill Park</a></u>.&nbsp;&nbsp; A c.1899  hydroelectric plant, formerly owned by the Virginia Electric and Power Company  (VEPCO) and now part of a retail, office, and residential redevelopment  project, still stands at the bottom of 12th Street on the <a href="http://www.venturerichmond.com/experiences/canalcruises.html">Canal Walk</a>.<br />

        Richmond grew and  prospered until after World War II.&nbsp; The tobacco industry continued at a  large scale, expanding with the construction of modern cigarette factories next  to the rail line alongside Tobacco Row in the first half of the 20th  century.&nbsp; Following a period when a variety of factors caused the city to  lose both population and businesses, the trend began to reverse.&nbsp; Today, Richmond  is at the intersection of Interstates 95 and 64 in the center of a metropolitan  region of 1.2 million people.&nbsp; Law, finance, and government are now the  primary drivers of its economy. &nbsp;A number of Fortune 500 companies,  including tobacco giant Phillip Morris USA, have their headquarters in the  city.&nbsp; Richmond&rsquo;s historic  districts and sites remain one of its biggest attractions.&nbsp; Visitors come  from all over the world to witness the legacy of one of the nation&rsquo;s largest  agricultural processing and shipping centers; the industrial center of the  South; the seat of the Confederacy; and the home to Thomas Jefferson&rsquo;s revered  temple to democracy in the New World, the <u><a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/testing/richmond/VirginiaStateCapitol.html">Virginia State Capitol</a></u>. </p>  </td>
