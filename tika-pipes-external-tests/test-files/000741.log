I made a new version (v4_0) of the inhibits GUI with the fix for the VME slot, now read from the DB, as it should be.
You'll get this version next time you restart the GUI.

L2 dead time is at 98% and L3 input is very low. Don't know why.

<pre>There is a hot calorimeter tower (light leak??) that's driving L1A unprescaled rate to ~1MHz.  You can reduce the deadtime by manually changing the prescale to that L1 trigger bit to zero.  </pre>

In Vxworks we have red b0l2pu00.Even though we are running L2Torture, we are not including any pulsar crates.

<pre>Yes, L2Pulsar is not at the moment included in L2TORTURE runs by default.  We'll change it after the silicon D-Mode this
afternoon so Pulsar is in default L2TORTURE.

<pre>PSM showed red Endplug -&gt; EPSW_1 (b0pcal02) at 0.3V 
 
Since crate was not accessible (end plug was not out) we had to power-cycle.  
That means (I couldn't find a description for this): Open "Racks" in "Process System Alarms" -&gt; "Detector Racks West" -&gt;  "EPSW" -&gt; click on "Reset Power Supply #1". Then wait a few minutes until it is green, and do a SMX calibration.

<pre>We did the sourcing of the whole PEM and shower-max in the plug. We had several problems with the new computer and the communication with RC which will be addressed during daytime when experts are around. 
 
We may need further time (if available) during the access to finish the scan of the plug, i.e. scan of the PHA (2-3 hours).

Trying to run L2Torture. L3 would not partition. Reset. evb turned red and instructed to clean up evb. Did that. L3 would still not partition (turn red). Then stopped and started L3 proxy. That fixed it. (so did not have to clean L3!).

same scenario: got busy TO from b0pcal02. Did HRR, turned green. In active it doesn't take any events, nothing is happening. Went to halt, shepherd b0pcal02. Recover, run, still nothing happening. suspecting evb problem.

<font color=red>Shift Summary: </font><pre>1. PSM alarm went off just before midnight due to EPSW_1 channel 0 (b0pcal02) at 0.3V. Couldn't reset the crate in the collision hall - not accessible. Power-cycled. SMX calibration done. 
 
2. PEM and Plug Shower Max souce calibration is done. 
PHA to be done - they will discuss with Ops manager.

think it's 16 evts problems. Saverio found the window that was logged in to b0tsi00. so now cleaning up evb since we are logged off from botsi00. So to be clear: I did not reboot b0tsi00, we just logged out. We are in start state during all of this.
