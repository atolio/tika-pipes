 The Clinton Presidency:<BR>
 A Foreign Policy for the Global Age
 <HR WIDTH="100%" NOSHADE>
</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P>
 President Clinton understood from the beginning of his presidency that the most pervasive force in our world is globalization.  He also understood that while globalization is inexorable, its benefits must be harnessed to advance our objectives of democracy, shared prosperity and peace.  The way for America to exercise its influence today is to build with our democratic partners an international system of strong alliances and institutions attuned to the challenges of a globalized world, to ensure this system is genuinely open to all who adhere to clearly defined standards, and to be ready to stand up for those standards when they are threatened.  The broad outlines of a foreign policy for the global age can’t be summed up on a bumper sticker, but they are reflected in the principles that have guided the Clinton foreign policy over the past eight years.
</P>

<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">
 Our Alliances with Europe and Asia are the Cornerstone of Our National Security, but They Must be Constantly Adapted to Meet Emerging Challenges.
</FONT></B></P>

<P>
 These core alliances are today stronger and arguably more durable because they are organized to advance an enduring set of shared interests, rather than to defeat a single threat.  President Clinton broke new ground in 1993 by welcoming our European and Asian allies’ desire to play a more responsible role while maintaining our troops and adapting our alliances in both regions.
</P>

<P><B><U>Working for a Peaceful, Democratic, Undivided Europe</U></B>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Revitalized, adapted and expanded NATO</B> from a static Cold War alliance to a magnet for new democracies, with new partners, members and missions; adapted its command structure; admitted Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic; created Partnership for Peace.</LI>
 <LI><B>Led NATO in its first military engagement</B> and stopped the killing in Bosnia.  The peace we brokered in Dayton has been sustained, a civil society complete with active opposition parties and non-governmental organizations is taking root, and national and local elections have taken place throughout the country.</LI>
 <LI><B>Took military action in Kosovo to stop ethnic cleansing and regional instability</B>.  Forced withdrawal of Serb forces and deployed an international presence in Kosovo &#151; with a 47,000 strong NATO-led force providing security for the province.  Achieved the safe and unconditional return of over 900,000 refugees, disbanded the Kosovo Liberation Army.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P><B><U>Adapting and Upholding our Alliance with Asia</U></B>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Updated our strategic alliance with Japan</B> through adoption of the Defense Guidelines and Joint Security Declaration to define how to respond together to post-Cold War threats.</LI>
 <LI><B>Reduced the North Korean threat</B> through deterrence, diplomacy.  Negotiated the October 1994 Framework Agreement to freeze and dismantle North Korea’s dangerous nuclear weapons fuel production and a moratorium on long-range missile testing in 1999.</LI>
 <LI><B>Strengthened cooperation with South Korea</B> to move forward to engage North Korea.  Jointly engaged in Four Party Talks and established Trilateral Group (the United States, Japan and South Korea) to coordinate North Korea policy which helped create the conditions for an eventual North-South dialogue.</LI>
</UL></P>

<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">
 Peace and Security for the United States Depends on Building Principled, Constructive, Clear-Eyed Relations with Our Former Adversaries.
</FONT></B></P>

<P>
 We must continue to be mindful of threats to the peace &#151; whether it is a Russian move against Georgia or a Chinese move against Taiwan &#151; while maximizing the chances that both nations evolve internally toward greater democracy, stability and prosperity.  To achieve both goals, we must continue to seize on the desire of both Russia and China to participate in the global economy and global institutions, insisting they accept the obligations as well as the benefits of integration.
</P>

<P><B><U>Building on Our Relationship with Russia</U></B>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Negotiated the exit of Russian troops</B> from the Baltics, brought Russian troops into NATO missions in the Balkans and won Russia’s active support for a just end to the Kosovo war.</LI>
 <LI><B>Brought Russia into the G-8</B>, APEC, and into relationships with NATO and international financial institutions.</LI>
 <LI><B>Reduced the nuclear danger</B>.

 <LI><B>Supported economic reform and the creation of a market economy</B>.  More than 250,000 Russian entrepreneurs have received U.S. training, consulting services or loans. Today 70 percent of the Russian economy is in private hands.</LI>
</UL></P>

<P><B><U>Building on Our Relationship with China</U></B>
<UL>
 <LI><B>Helped maintain peace in the Taiwan Straits</B> and worked with China to maintain stability on Korean Peninsula.</LI>
 <LI><B>Brought China into global non-proliferation regimes</B> &#151; Chemical Weapons Convention, CTBT and Biological Weapons Convention.</LI>
 <LI><B>Negotiated terms for China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, with Permanent Normal Trade Relations</B>.  Most constructive breakthrough in U.S.-China relations since normalization in 1979 &#151; will entangle China more deeply in a rules-based international system and change China internally.</LI>

 Local Conflicts can have Global Consequences.  The Purpose of Peacemaking, Whether by Diplomacy or Force, Must be to Resolve Conflicts Before They Escalate and Harm Our Vital Interests.
</FONT></B></P>

<P>
 In a global age, arguments for peacemaking are even stronger: to defuse conflicts before they escalate and harm our interests.  America’s dominant power is more likely to be accepted if it is harnessed to the cause of peace.  
</P>

<UL>

 Economic Integration Advances Both Our Interests and Our Values, but Also Accentuates the Need to Alleviate Economic Disparity.

<P>
 As the first president who has understood the connections of the global economy and its connection to our prosperity, President Clinton has led the United States toward its greatest expansion in world trade in history &#151; from $4 to $6.6 trillion a year.
